   <title>Using atomic updates with the system role <emphasis>Transactional Server</emphasis></title>
   <!-- boo#1092953, boo#1093098 -->
   <para>
    The installer supports the system role <emphasis>Transactional
    Server</emphasis>. This system role features an update system that
    applies updates atomically (as a single operation) and makes them easy to
    revert should that become necessary.
    These features are based on the package management tools that all
    other &suse; and &osuse; distributions also rely on. This means that the
    vast majority of RPM
    packages that work with other system roles of &thisversion; also work
    with the system role <emphasis>Transactional Server</emphasis>.
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>Incompatible packages</title>
    <para>
     Some packages modify the contents of <filename>/var</filename> or

     These packages are incompatible. If you find such a package, file a
     bug report.

       Before a system update is started, a new Btrfs snapshot of the root
       file system is created. Then, all the changes from the update are
       installed into that Btrfs snapshot. To complete the update, you can
       then restart the system into the new snapshot.
      </para>

     </formalpara>
     <para>
      To make this setup work, two additional changes to the file system
      needed to be made: To allow writing user configuration in

    When using this system role, by default, the system will perform a daily

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi">
   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing &opensuse; on a system that boots using UEFI (Unified
    Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to check for any
    firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and, if available, to
    install such an update. A pre-installation of Windows 8 or later is a
    strong indication that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it
    to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. However,
    there is no clear data of how much is <quote>too much</quote>.
   </para>
   <para>
    &opensuse; minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS. The minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about
    the location of the &opensuse; boot loader. Upstream Linux kernel features
    that use the UEFI storage area for storing boot and crash information
    (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been disabled by default. Nevertheless, it
    is recommended to install any firmware updates the hardware vendor
    recommends.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="installation-uefi-part">
  <!-- bnc#850056 -->
   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of partitioning
    arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema uses globally unique
    identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32 hexadecimal digits) to identify
    devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB 2) try to automatically
    generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write them to the
    firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a rewrite in the
    firmware. A rewrite consists of two different operations: Removing the old
    entry and creating a new entry that replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted entries and
    frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem arises when faulty
    firmware does not collect and free those entries. This can result in a
    non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    To work around this problem, convert the legacy MBR partition to GPT.

   <title>Seamless upgrade from &opensuseleap; 15.2</title>
   <!-- bnc#1182629 -->
   <para>
    &opensuseleap; 15.3 is newly built on top of binary rpms from &sles;. This
    change was introduced as part of the Closing The Leap Gap (CtLG) effort to
    bring &opensuseleap; and &sles; closer together.
   </para>
   <para>
    Unlike 15.2, the default installation of &opensuseleap; 15.3 contains the
    majority of rpms from &sles;. These rpms are signed by SUSE LLC instead of
    using the &opensuse; key. The <package>libzypp</package> package version
    12.25.8 introduced whitelist for the SUSE LLC and &opensuse; vendor exchange
    to allow seamless migration. This whitelist removes the need to specify
    <literal>--allow-vendor-change</literal>
     for &opensuse; and SUSE LLC vendor exchange only. You might still need to
     specify
    <literal>--allow-vendor-change</literal> during migration if you are using
    OBS repositories signed with other keys.
   </para>
   <para>
    &opensuseleap; releases older than 15.2 do not contain this feature because
    they are not supported anymore. All users are advised to upgrade to
    &opensuseleap; 15.2 with the latest updates before upgrading to 15.3. The
    following parameters can be used as a workaround for
